//inheritance: an OOp principle where you can define a hierarchical relationship amongst classes
//base class: AKA superclass AKA parent class
//derived class: AKA sub class AKA child class
//sub class inherits the same and behavior from a super class
//in swift, structs do not support inhertance
//in swift, no universal base class
//ex: no Object class like Jaca
//use keyword "super" to refer to a member of the super class
//use keyword "override" to override behavior or state in a subclass
